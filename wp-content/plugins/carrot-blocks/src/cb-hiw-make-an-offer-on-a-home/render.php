    <h2>So How Do We Make An Offer On A Home?</h2>
    <p>The answer to this question might surprise you, but once you’ll understand it, you’ll realize that this is the best way to formulate offers, and they are always fair and <strong>based on the current market condition in Kansas City</strong>. We offer cash for houses in Kansas City, and they are always FAIR!</p>

          <h3 class="">Tell Me More!</h3>
          <p class="">With this process of making offers you are always getting a fair offer since it is based on other houses in the neighborhood that have been sold in a similar condition your property – You can’t beat that!</p>
          <p class=""><strong>First</strong>, we will need to have a good understanding about the condition of your house. We’ll ask you a set of questions that will help us evaluate the cost of repairs and updates that are required in order to bring it to current market condition.</p>
          <p class=""><strong>Second</strong>, we will look for similar houses in the neighborhood (similar size, number of bedrooms, bathroom etc.) that <strong><a href="sales-comparison-approach/">we’re recently sold in As-Is condition</a></strong> and are in a similar condition to your house (also known as “comparable sales”, or “comps”). <br>We always compare apples to apples. It doesn’t make sense to compare a fully renovated “like new” house with an one that has not been updated for years.</p>

          </div>
          <p class=""><strong>Third</strong>, we take the average price per square foot of the As-Is comparable sales and apply it to your house – and Voila! Here’s your offer!</p>
